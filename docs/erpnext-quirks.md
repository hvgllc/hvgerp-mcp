# ERPNext quirks this server works around

Behaviours of Frappe/ERPNext that are surprising enough to have caused a bug
here, with the workaround the code now carries. Read this before removing
something that looks redundant — each of these exists because it was not.

The reader is a contributor. A user never hits these: the workarounds are
already in place.

### TimestampMismatchError on submit (2026-02-18)

**Symptom**: `frappe.client.submit` returns `TimestampMismatchError` when
passing `{doctype, name}` without the `modified` field.

**Cause**: Frappe uses optimistic locking based on `modified`. The `submit` API
expects the full doc with its `modified` timestamp to verify that it has not
been changed in the meantime.

**Applied fix**: All submit handlers now perform a `GET` of the doc before
passing it to `frappe.client.submit`:

```typescript
const doc = await ctx.client.get("Sales Order", input.name as string);
const result = await ctx.client.callMethod("frappe.client.submit", {
  doc: { ...doc, doctype: "Sales Order" },
});
```

**Fixed files**:

- `src/tools/operations.ts` — `erpnext_doc_submit`
- `src/tools/sales.ts` — `erpnext_sales_order_submit`,
  `erpnext_sales_invoice_submit`

**Note**: `frappe.client.cancel` does NOT have this problem — it accepts
`{doctype, name}`.

### Guarded Kanban moves need fresh state and a timestamp (2026-09-05)

**Symptom**: A cached status can agree with the board after another writer has
already moved the document. Even an uncached GET leaves a race before PUT.

**Applied fix**: Task, Opportunity and Issue adapters read with
`{ skipCache: true }`, check `fromColumn`, then send `{ status, modified }` in
the update. A missing, non-string or blank timestamp fails closed without PUT.
The timestamp is forwarded unchanged. Conflict, permission and transport errors
remain `FrappeAPIError`; adapters do not retry writes or report false success.

**Upstream contract inspected**: Frappe commit
`755b5cb81fabb431265690fca07f4a8038a5599a`:

- [REST update_doc](https://github.com/frappe/frappe/blob/755b5cb81fabb431265690fca07f4a8038a5599a/frappe/api/v1.py#L46)
  loads with `for_update=True`, applies the request fields and calls `save()`.
- [Document save path](https://github.com/frappe/frappe/blob/755b5cb81fabb431265690fca07f4a8038a5599a/frappe/model/document.py#L353)
  preserves the submitted timestamp as `_original_modified` and compares it
  against another locked read before updating the database. A mismatch raises
  `TimestampMismatchError`.

This is source-level verification at that commit, not proof of the version or
custom hooks on a deployed ERPNext site. Tests use the real client/cache with
fake HTTP responses; they verify outgoing tokens and error propagation, not
database locking. Recheck this contract when supporting a different Frappe
version. Generic document updates and transition rules are unchanged.

### Item's unit of measure is `stock_uom`, not `uom`

**Symptom**: `erpnext_item_create` accepted a `uom` argument and the created
Item had no unit of measure set — silently, with no error from Frappe.

**Cause**: the Item DocType stores it as `stock_uom`. Frappe ignores unknown
fields on create rather than rejecting them, so a wrong field name produces a
successful call and an incomplete record.

**Applied fix** (`src/tools/inventory.ts`): the tool keeps `uom` as its argument
name — it is what a caller expects — and maps it on the way out:

```typescript
if (input.uom) data.stock_uom = input.uom as string;
```

The argument description now states the mapping, so the discrepancy is visible
from `tools/list` rather than only from the source.

**Note on this entry**: it previously read "Fixed" and had done since the
document was imported from another repository (`b1ce00d`, "Sync from
pml-cloud"). The fix existed _there_. In this repository the mapping was never
applied, and the bug survived until 2026-07-31 — protected by a note claiming it
was already handled. Imported documentation describes the codebase it came from;
carrying it over without re-verifying is how a defect gets a certificate of good
health.

### FrappeClient now parses `_server_messages`

**Historical symptom**: Frappe errors have 2 levels: `exc_type` (e.g.:
`MandatoryError`) and `_server_messages` (e.g.:
`["selling_price_list is required"]`). `FrappeClient.handleError()` only
extracted the first — cryptic messages on the agent side.

**Applied fix**: Dedicated parser `extractServerMessages()` that decodes
Frappe's double JSON encoding and concatenates the useful messages:

- `src/api/frappe-client.ts:80` — function `extractServerMessages()`
- `src/api/frappe-client.ts:181` — usage in the HTTP error path

### `erpnext_sales_order_create` accepts critical defaults

**Historical symptom**: Creating a Sales Order failed with
`MandatoryError: selling_price_list` on a fresh instance, because the field was
neither in the schema nor passed through.

**Applied fix**:

- `src/tools/sales.ts:324` — `selling_price_list` added to the schema
- `src/tools/sales.ts:381` — passed to the creation payload

### `FrappeClient` retries transient read errors

**Historical symptom**: A temporary 429/5xx or a network error would immediately
fail reads, even when a short retry would have sufficed.

**Applied fix**: `FrappeClient` now retries `GET`s on configured transient
statuses (`408`, `429`, `502`, `503`, `504`) and on network errors, with
exponential backoff and `Retry-After` support.

### `kanban-viewer` guards saves without `serverTools`

**Historical symptom**: In the kanban card detail modal, `handleSaveDetail`
called `app.callServerTool` without checking
`app.getHostCapabilities()?.serverTools`, unlike the other viewer mutations.

**Applied fix**: `handleSaveDetail` now fails explicitly with the same guard as
card moves when the host does not support proxied server calls.

### Fresh instance: `base_rounded_total = None` → TypeError

**Historical symptom**: On a fresh ERPNext instance (without setup wizard),
submitting a Sales Order/Invoice failed with `TypeError: abs(None)` in
`validate_grand_total()`, because `base_rounded_total`/`rounded_total` stay
`None` when the rounding configuration is not initialized.

**Applied fix**: `withRoundedTotalFallback()` sets `disable_rounded_total: 1` on
the pre-submit doc whenever `base_rounded_total` or `rounded_total` is `null`
and it isn't already set:

- `src/tools/submit-helpers.ts` — `withRoundedTotalFallback()`
- `src/tools/operations.ts` — `erpnext_doc_submit`
- `src/tools/sales.ts` — `erpnext_sales_order_submit`,
  `erpnext_sales_invoice_submit`

# Tools Reference (129)

Full reference for all ERPNext MCP tools. See [README](../README.md) for
overview.

## Identity (2) → doclist-viewer

| Tool              | DocType       | Operations                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `erpnext_whoami`  | User/Employee | Caller's User id, full name, roles, linked Employee, and `identity_mode`                  |
| `erpnext_my_work` | six doctypes  | Open ToDos, tasks, projects, leave applications, expense claims, timesheets (per section) |

`erpnext_whoami` takes no arguments and resolves the caller itself. Its `roles`,
`employee` and `employee_lookup` fields distinguish "empty" from "withheld", so
read them before telling anyone they hold no roles or have no HR record.

| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `erpnext_calendar_events` | List      | Calendar range, repeating events expanded         |

| `erpnext_doc_submit`      | Submit    | Any submittable document                          |
| `erpnext_doc_cancel`      | Cancel    | Any submitted document                            |
| `erpnext_doc_assign`      | Assign    | Native assignment (ToDo + notification) to users  |
| `erpnext_doc_unassign`    | Unassign  | Remove one user's native assignment               |
| `erpnext_file_upload`     | Upload    | Attach base64 data as a native File               |
| `erpnext_method_call`     | Call      | Any allowlisted whitelisted method by dotted path |

`erpnext_file_upload` requires `file_name`, `content_base64`,
`attached_to_doctype`, and `attached_to_name`; `attached_to_field` is optional.
Files are private by default (`is_private: false` makes them public), accept no
local path or URL, are capped at 10 MiB decoded by default (override with
positive-integer-byte `ERPNEXT_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`), require write permission on
the DocType, and return native `File` metadata.

`erpnext_calendar_events` takes `start` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), optional `end` (defaults
to seven days after `start`), optional `user`, and optional `limit`. It goes
through the same call the ERPNext calendar uses, so a repeating event comes back
once per occurrence in the range, each carrying `recurring_from` (the stored
master's start). A plain `erpnext_doc_list` on `Event` cannot do this: it
returns the single stored row. Scope is the caller's own calendar: open events
that are Public, owned by them, or shared with them through DocShare.
Participation alone does not make an event visible, so the result is the shared
calendar rather than a complete personal schedule.

`erpnext_method_call` reaches business endpoints that no typed tool wraps,
including custom-app methods that are the only supported way to change a field
the document API refuses to write directly (a `validate` hook that blocks the
field, an `on_update` guard, a permlevel). It takes `method` (dotted path),
optional `args`, optional `http_method` (`POST` by default; `GET` only for
methods whitelisted read-only), and optional `invalidate` (`{doctype, name}`):
pass that last one whenever the method mutates a document, or a later read may
be served a stale cache entry.

Every call runs as the API key's own ERPNext user, so a method that user may not
call still fails at the server. `ERPNEXT_METHOD_ALLOWLIST` narrows the tool
further when you want it to: it accepts exact dotted paths, `prefix.*` patterns,
or a bare `*`, and unset it imposes no restriction of its own. Setting it is
worth it when an agent should reach only a few named endpoints, since the key
carries its user's full permissions and the allowlist is then the only thing
keeping a prompt-injected agent away from the rest. Method paths are validated
against `[A-Za-z0-9_.]` before the URL is built no matter how the allowlist is
configured, so a crafted `method` can never append a query string or traverse to
another endpoint.

```json
{
  "method": "my_app.api.update_task_meta",
  "args": { "task": "TASK-2026-00001", "meta": "sku: ABC-1" },
  "invalidate": { "doctype": "Task", "name": "TASK-2026-00001" }
}
```

## Discovery (1)

| Tool                     | DocType | Operations                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `erpnext_doctype_fields` | any     | Field schema of a DocType, permission-gated |

`erpnext_doctype_fields` answers "what does this DocType actually store?" before
a `_list`, `_get`, or `erpnext_doc_update` call has to guess. It takes
`doctype`, optional `search` (substring on fieldname and label), and optional
`include_hidden`. Each field comes back with `fieldname`, `label`, `fieldtype`,
`options` (the target DocType for a Link, the choices for a Select), `reqd`,
`read_only`, `in_list_view`, `permlevel`, and `description`; layout-only
fieldtypes (Section Break, Column Break, Tab Break, Fold, Heading, HTML, Button)
are dropped. The document header reports `module`, `is_single`,
`is_child_table`, `is_submittable`, `is_tree`, and `title_field`.

Reading a sample document is not a substitute: it shows only the fields that
happen to be filled in, without labels, types, or link targets.

The underlying Frappe metadata endpoint performs no permission check of its own,
so the tool asks ERPNext first (`frappe.client.has_permission`) and fails with a
permission error when the caller cannot read the DocType. `permlevel` above 0
marks a field governed by a separate role permission, which can be absent from
documents even when the DocType itself is readable.

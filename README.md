MCP server for [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com) / Frappe ERP — **129 tools**
across **15 categories**, with **7 interactive UI viewers**.

Connect any MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code
Copilot, custom) to your ERPNext instance via the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

Works with **self-hosted** and **ERPNext Cloud** (frappe.cloud) instances.

> Built on **[@casys/mcp-server](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-server)** — the
> MCP server framework (concurrency, auth, MCP Apps, observability) that powers
> this project.

> Forked from **[@casys/mcp-erpnext](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext)**
> by Casys AI, MIT licensed. Everything up to 2.6.0 is their work; this fork
> renames the package and adds tools of its own.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Generate API credentials in ERPNext:

1. Login to ERPNext → top-right menu → **My Settings**
2. Section **API Access** → **Generate Keys**
3. Copy `API Key` and `API Secret`

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code (npm)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "erpnext": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hvgllc/hvgerp-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ERPNEXT_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "ERPNEXT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ERPNEXT_API_SECRET": "your-api-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Works with ERPNext Cloud** — set `ERPNEXT_URL` to your Frappe Cloud URL
> (e.g. `https://mycompany.erpnext.com` or `https://mysite.frappe.cloud`). API
> key authentication works the same way on self-hosted and cloud instances.

### VS Code Copilot

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "erpnext": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hvgllc/hvgerp-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ERPNEXT_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "ERPNEXT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ERPNEXT_API_SECRET": "your-api-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Deno (stdio)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "erpnext": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["run", "--allow-all", "server.ts"],
      "env": {
        "ERPNEXT_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "ERPNEXT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ERPNEXT_API_SECRET": "your-api-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP mode

For a shared, always-on server rather than one process per client:
[how to run the HTTP server](docs/http-deployment.md). Note it is breaking for
pre-2026 HTTP clients in 3.0.0.

### Category filtering

Load only the categories you need:

```bash
npx -y @hvgllc/hvgerp-mcp --categories=sales,inventory
```

## Fresh Instance Setup

A blank ERPNext instance has no master data, so business tools fail validation
until it exists. See
[Seed a blank ERPNext instance](docs/fresh-instance-setup.md).

## UI Viewers

Seven interactive [MCP Apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps)
viewers, registered as `ui://hvgerp-mcp/{name}`:

| Viewer           | Description                                                      | Interactive Features                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `doclist-viewer` | Generic document table with sort, filter, pagination, CSV export | Row click → inline detail panel with Submit/Cancel + sendMessage navigation. Chip filters for status columns. Max 6 columns, rest in detail panel. |
| `invoice-viewer` | Sales/Purchase Invoice with parties, items, totals               | Item click → stock balance + item info panel. Submit/Cancel/Payment actions. sendMessage to payment entries and customer invoices.                 |
| `stock-viewer`   | Stock balance table with color-coded qty badges                  | Row click → item info + recent movements. sendMessage to stock chart, item details, stock entries.                                                 |
| `chart-viewer`   | Universal chart renderer (12 types via Recharts)                 | Click bar/pie/line data points → sendMessage drill-down into underlying documents.                                                                 |
| `kanban-viewer`  | Read-write kanban for Task, Opportunity, Issue                   | Drag-and-drop moves, inline edit (priority, progress, dates), sendMessage to Timesheets/Quotations/Related docs.                                   |
| `kpi-viewer`     | Big number card with delta, sparkline, trend                     | Click number → sendMessage to exception list. Click sparkline → trend chart.                                                                       |
| `funnel-viewer`  | Trapezoid sales funnel with conversion rates                     | Click stage → sendMessage to document list at that stage. Stage action buttons.                                                                    |

### Cross-viewer navigation

Viewers communicate via `app.sendMessage()` — clicking a button in one viewer
injects a message into the conversation, which triggers the AI to call the right
tool and open the appropriate viewer.

The server auto-injects navigation metadata into tool results:

- `_rowAction` — which tool to call when a row is clicked
- `_sendMessageHints` — navigation buttons shown in detail panels (e.g.
  "Orders", "Invoices")
- `_drillDown` / `_trendDrillDown` — sendMessage templates for KPI and chart
  click-through

### Refresh model

All viewers carry a `refreshRequest` payload for safe revalidation via
`app.callServerTool()`:

- `kanban-viewer` revalidates after mutations and on focus
- All other viewers support focus refresh + manual refresh button

### Building UI viewers

```bash
cd src/ui
npm install
node build-all.mjs
```

## Tools (129)

129 tools across 16 categories. Each `_list` tool returns interactive results
via the doclist-viewer with row click, inline detail, and cross-viewer
navigation.

- **Identity** (2) — `erpnext_whoami` (who the server believes the caller is:
  User id, roles, linked Employee, and whether the connection is per-caller or a
  shared service account) and `erpnext_my_work` (everything currently open for
  that person). Call `erpnext_whoami` before answering any first-person request:
  every other tool needs a concrete user or employee id, and this is the only
  one that produces it.
- **Sales** (17) — Customers, Sales Orders, Invoices, and Quotations with full
  CRUD, Submit, and Cancel.
- **Purchasing** (11) — Suppliers, Purchase Orders, Purchase Invoices, Receipts,
  and Supplier Quotations.
- **Inventory** (9) — Items, Stock Balance, Warehouses, and Stock Entries.
- **Accounting** (6) — Chart of Accounts (filterable by `disabled`), Journal
  Entries, and Payment Entries.
- **HR** (12) — Employees, Attendance, Leave Applications, Salary Slips, Payroll
  Entries, and Expense Claims.
- **Project** (9) — Projects, Tasks (with native assignment), and Timesheets.
- **Delivery** (5) — Delivery Notes and Shipments.
- **Manufacturing** (7) — BOMs, Work Orders, and Job Cards.
- **CRM** (8) — Leads, Opportunities, Contacts, and Campaigns.
- **Assets** (8) — Assets, Movements, Maintenance records, and Categories.
- **Operations** (12) — Generic CRUD, native assignment, and file upload for any
  DocType (`erpnext_doc_*`, `erpnext_file_upload`), plus `erpnext_method_call`
  for allowlisted whitelisted-method calls and `erpnext_calendar_events`, which
  reads a date range the way the ERPNext calendar does so a repeating event
  appears once per occurrence instead of once in total.
- **Kanban** (2) — Read-write boards for Task, Opportunity, and Issue with
  drag-and-drop.
- **Analytics** (17) — 11 analytics charts (bar, area, treemap, radar, scatter,
  P&L…), 5 KPIs with sparklines, and a sales funnel.
- **Setup** (3) — Company creation and assignable user listing.
- **Discovery** (1) — `erpnext_doctype_fields`: the field schema of any DocType
  (name, label, type, link target, mandatory, permlevel), gated on the caller's
  own read permission. Use it instead of inferring a schema from one sample
  document, which only shows the fields that happen to be filled in.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ERPNEXT_URL`              | Yes      | ERPNext base URL — self-hosted (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`) or cloud (e.g. `https://mycompany.erpnext.com`)                                                            |
| `ERPNEXT_API_KEY`          | stdio    | API Key from User Settings. Over HTTP, leave it unset and let each caller's own token decide who the server acts as (see _Caller identity_)                              |
| `ERPNEXT_API_SECRET`       | stdio    | API Secret from User Settings                                                                                                                                            |
| `MCP_CALLER_IDENTITY`      | No       | `required` \| `optional` \| `off`. HTTP only. Defaults to `required` when no API key/secret is set, `off` when they are                                                  |
| `ERPNEXT_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | No       | Maximum decoded file-upload size in bytes (positive integer; default: 10 MiB)                                                                                            |
| `ERPNEXT_METHOD_ALLOWLIST` | No       | Comma-separated dotted paths or `prefix.*` patterns that `erpnext_method_call` may invoke. Unset means no extra restriction beyond the API key's own ERPNext permissions |
| `MCP_MRTR_SIGNING_KEY`     | No       | Exactly 64 lowercase hex characters; enables signed ambiguous-link elicitation. **Single-instance deployments only** — see below                                         |

### Caller identity (HTTP)

Over HTTP the server can act **as the user who made the call** instead of under
one shared ERPNext account. Each tool call forwards that user's own verified
access token to Frappe as `Authorization: HVGKeycloak <token>`; Frappe resolves
it to a `User` and applies that user's roles and row-level permissions. Two
people calling the same tool therefore get different rows, and every write is
attributed to the person who asked for it.

This needs an OAuth/OIDC auth provider (`MCP_OAUTH_JWKS_URL`) whose tokens carry
an `email` claim, and an ERPNext side that accepts the scheme. `sub` is not
accepted as a fallback identity: it maps to no ERPNext user, so a deployment
with the wrong claims fails loudly instead of quietly serving the wrong data.

`MCP_CALLER_IDENTITY=required` refuses any call that carries no usable identity.
`optional` binds the identity when present and otherwise falls back to the
static API key. `off` is the pre-3.1 behaviour. Under `required` the read cache
is per caller and the startup cache warm is skipped — there is no user to warm
it as.

MRTR is opt-in. Without this key, or when the client does not advertise
elicitation, ambiguous links keep returning the existing actionable ambiguity
error instead of prompting for a selection.

> **Do not run MRTR behind a load balancer with this configuration.** The
> signing key proves a retry token is authentic; it does not make it single-use.
> That is the job of a replay store, and the default one is process-local. Share
> the key across two instances and the same signed retry validates on both —
> creating the purchase order, leave application or expense claim **twice**,
> irreversibly once submitted.
>
> A multi-instance deployment must pass a shared atomic `mrtr.replayStore` to
> `McpApp` (Redis satisfies the contract with `SET key 1 NX EXAT`). The
> framework logs a warning at startup whenever MRTR is enabled without one —
> that warning is not noise, it is this paragraph.

## Architecture

Tools are grouped by business domain under `src/tools/`, the Frappe REST client
is dependency-free, and each UI viewer is a separate build under `src/ui/`. Full
layout: [repository layout](docs/architecture.md).

## npm Package

The npm package (`@hvgllc/hvgerp-mcp`) is a single self-contained bundle with
zero runtime dependencies. UI viewers are embedded. Requires Node >= 20.
